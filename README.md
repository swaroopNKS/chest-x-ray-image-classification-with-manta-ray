# chest-x-ray-image-classification-with-manta-ray
In this project, I developed an approach for chest X-ray image classification by combining Manta Ray Optimization (MRO) with a deep learning model.  - Accuracy: MRO for hyperparameter tuning resulted in a 9% increase in classification accuracy for disease like pneumonia when compared to existing models(based on few collected research papers).
